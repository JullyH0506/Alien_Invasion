## Game Description
Use right and left arrows to control your ship. Press space to fire. When you start the game, a fleet of aliens appears, which moves across and down the screen. Your challenge is to destroy all aliens, but be careful: aliens can shoot back. When an alien reaches the bottom of the screen or hits the player's ship with a bullet, then the player loses a ship. You have only three ships (lives). As soon as you destroy all fleet you will go to a new level: a new fleet will appear, which will move more quickly. When you lose all your ships, the game is over. 

Also you can press 'Q' to quit or 'P' to play.
